120	Adjudicated	Neutral	It’s been a horrible time to see such death and destruction, especially when you come out of what was the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest. There’s never been an economy like what we had produced, but we’ll produce it again. And I think we’ll produce it again very fast. The medical and healthcare advances we’ve made are critical to our continued progress. We’ve rapidly developed the most expansive and accurate testing system anywhere in the world and have completed more than 3.3 million tests. To date, we have authorized 48 separate coronavirus tests, and the FDA is working with 300 companies and labs to widen our capacity still further. Today, Abbott Labs announced that it has developed an antibody test that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the coronavirus and potentially developed immunity. It’s a great test. The company says these tests could be available to screen up to 20 million people in a matter of weeks.
128	Adjudicated	Neutral	We will prove to you that we who stand ready to make extreme sacrifices for what we believe, are giving you a true picture of the purposes of the Communist Party. It is customary for a client to be introduced to the jury by his or her attorney.  I am my own attorney. I must therefore, introduce myself.  I am an American of Irish decent.  My father, Thomas Flynn, was born in Maine.  My mother, Anne Gurley, was born in Galway, Ireland.  I was born in Concord, New Hampshire, 62 years ago.  I married in 1908, separated from my husband shortly thereafter, and have always used my own name.  My only son, Fred, died in 1940 at the age of 29 from a chest cancer.  I reside with my sister, who is a retired school teacher.  We have lived in New York City for the past 52 years.  My mother was a skilled tailoress; my father a quarry worker who worked his way through the engineering school at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.  My father, grandfather, and all my uncles were members of labor unions. To continue, ladies and gentlemen, one of the essential issues in this case is my individual intent, the intent with which I joined the Communist Party and have remained a member of it, and the intent with which I have tried to carry out its program. My intent has been shaped out of my earlier experiences and my reaction  to the conditions of life, especially the conditions of the worker.
271	Adjudicated	Optimistic	That is why I love this country. And in my own life, in my own small way, I’ve tried to give back to this country that has given me so much. That’s why I left a job at a law firm for a career in public service, working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities. Because I believe that each of us—no matter what our age or background or walk of life—each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation. It’s a belief Barack shares, a belief at the heart of his life’s work. It’s what he did all those years ago on the streets of Chicago, setting up job training to get people back to work and after-school programs to keep kids safe, working block by block to help people lift up their families.
349	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	There is a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border that requires urgent action. Thousands of children are being exploited by ruthless coyotes and vicious cartels and gangs. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. In fact, many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey up to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually accosted or assaulted. Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for urgent medical care. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are flooding through our border and into our communities, including meth, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl. Drugs kill 78,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which comes across our southern border. We can stop heroin.
272	Adjudicated	Neutral	I would move on by Greece and take my mind to Mount Olympus. And I would see Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Euripides and Aristophanes assembled around the Parthenon. And I would watch them around the Parthenon as they discussed the great and eternal issues of reality. But I wouldn't stop there. I would go on, even to the great heyday of the Roman Empire. And I would see developments around there, through various emperors and leaders. But I wouldn't stop there.
454	Adjudicated	Optimistic	Finally, I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end—where all men and all churches are treated as equal—where every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choice—where there is no Catholic vote, no anti-Catholic vote, no bloc voting of any kind—and where Catholics, Protestants and Jews, at both the lay and pastoral level, will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past, and promote instead the American ideal of brotherhood. That is the kind of America in which I believe. And it represents the kind of Presidency in which I believe—a great office that must neither be humbled by making it the instrument of any one religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any one religious group. I believe in a President whose religious views are his own private affair, neither imposed by him upon the Nation or imposed by the Nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.
427	Adjudicated	Neutral	"Earlier today, we heard the beginning of the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States: ""We, the people."" It's a very eloquent beginning. But when that document was completed on the seventeenth of September in 1787, I was not included in that ""We, the people."" I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton just left me out by mistake. But through the process of amendment, interpretation, and court decision, I have finally been included in ""We, the people."" Today I am an inquisitor. An hyperbole would not be fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that I feel right now. My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction, of the Constitution."
109	Adjudicated	Optimistic	We'll also keep urging Congress to approve America's free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. And we will continue to protect this homeland by defeating the terrorists and extremists abroad, so we do not have to face them here at home. As January 20th draws near, some of you may be anxious about finding a new job, or a new place to live. I know how you feel. But between now and then, we must keep our attention on the task at hand -- because the American people expect no less. Earlier this year, I promised that I would sprint to the finish. I am keeping that promise, and I know I have given some of you a good workout along the way. As we head into this final stretch, I ask you to remain focused on the goals ahead. I will be honored to stand with you at the finish line.
267	Adjudicated	Optimistic	I will be out there fighting with you. I am not going away. I love this state. I will continue to serve. I look forward…in this audience tonight, there are candidates that will stand for election in this state and win. And I look forward to helping you, helping nurture the next generation of leaders, for the values that we care about. And for now it is good night, but it is not good bye. I love you guys to death. Thank you so very much for all you’ve done. Thank you, thank you.
244	Adjudicated	Neutral	Actually, a number of people in Washington were surprised that I was invited to speak here -- and even more surprised when I accepted the invitation. They seem to think that it’s easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle than for a Kennedy to come to the campus of Liberty Baptist College. In honor of our meeting, I have asked Dr. Falwell, as your Chancellor, to permit all the students an extra hour next Saturday night before curfew. And in return, I have promised to watch the Old Time Gospel Hour next Sunday morning. I realize that my visit may be a little controversial. But as many of you have heard, Dr. Falwell recently sent me a membership in the Moral Majority -- and I didn't even apply for it. And I wonder if that means that I'm a member in good standing.
132	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	It's important to recognize that while differences in theology exist between the churches in America, we share a common creed of moral convictions. And where the affairs of our nation are concerned, it's usually a sound rule to focus on the latter -- on the great moral principles that urge us all on a common course. Whether it was the cause of abolition, or civil rights, or the right to life itself, no movement of conscience can succeed in America that cannot speak to the convictions of religious people. We separate church and state affairs in this country, and for good reason. No religion should dictate to the state nor should the state interfere with the free practice of religion. But in recent years, the notion of the separation of church and state has been taken by some well beyond its original meaning. They seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of God. Religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life. It's as if they're intent on establishing a new religion in America -- the religion of secularism. They are wrong.
58	Adjudicated	Optimistic	You know, Kansans look out for each other. We cooperate, whether on the farm or the school or church, the workplace – we're all part of the same community. And today, voters across Kansas came together. We chose to put people before politics. [cheers and applause] That means cooperation, compromise and bipartisanship. This campaign was guided by a spirit that put our families first, and tonight I'm here to tell you that that is what will guide me as your governor as well. [cheers and applause]
3	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	Mr. Speaker, Members, I rise today really with a very heavy heart, one that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were killed and injured this week. Only the most foolish and the most callous would not understand the grief that has really gripped our people and millions across the world. This unspeakable act on the United States has really -- really forced me, however, to rely on my moral compass, my conscience, and my God for direction. September 11th changed the world. Our deepest fears now haunt us. Yet, I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States. This is a very complex and complicated matter.
489	Adjudicated	Neutral	And from the first day in office, I’ve taken a historic action to support America’s families and to protect the unborn.  (Applause.)  And during my first week in office, I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City Policy, and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of Title X taxpayer funding.  (Applause.) I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or that encourages the destruction of human life.  (Applause.) At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life.  (Applause.)
436	Adjudicated	Optimistic	This was a hard-fought race. I have a tremendous amount of respect for anyone motivated to run for office based on their personal experience, and Lea Vukmir ran for office advocating a better education for her daughter, and I want to thank her for her 16 years of service in our state legislature. Tonight, I also give thanks to my mother. She passed away last year during this journey just as I was getting started, and through her struggles she became strong and so did I and the strength and passion that she passed on to me have been with me every step of the way. In sharing the story of my own family's battle with addiction and mental illness, I wanted to give hope to other families who face the same challenges by letting them know you're not alone and we may can make progress together.
479	Adjudicated	Optimistic	It has been a very moving experience for all of us. Five members of my Cabinet are here, the Secretaries of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. The Secretary of the Army is here. We have all come, first of all, to see firsthand what it is you've been going through; secondly, to pledge to do our part to help make you whole; and thirdly, to tell you that we're for you. We have hardly ever seen such a remarkable demonstration of courage and commitment and cooperation and basic human strength, and we are very impressed and proud to be Americans when we see what you have done in the face of this terrible disaster. We know that this rebuilding is going to be a long-term prospect, and we also know that there are some very immediate and pressing human needs that many people have. Before I left this morning, I took some steps I wanted to tell you about. First, I authorized James Lee Witt and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide 100 percent of the direct Federal assistance for all the emergency—[inaudible]—work going to be undertaken here.
62	Adjudicated	Neutral	This afternoon we want to talk about the ballot or the bullet. The ballot or the bullet explains itself. But before we get into it, since this is the year of the ballot or the bullet, I would like to clarify some things that refer to me personally, concerning my own personal position. I'm still a Muslim. That is, my religion is still Islam. My religion is still Islam. I still credit Mr. Muhammad for what I know and what I am. He's the one who opened my eyes. At present I am the minister of the newly founded Muslim Mosque Incorporated, which has its offices in the Theresa Hotel right in the heart of Harlem, that's the black belt in New York City. And when we realize that Adam Clayton Powell, is a Christian minister, he has Abyssinian Baptist Church, but at the same time he's more famous for his political struggling. And Dr. King is a Christian minister from Atlanta Georgia, or in Atlanta Georgia, but he's become more famous for being involved in the civil rights struggle. There's another in New York, Rev. Galamison, I don't know if you've heard of him out here, he's a Christian minister from Brooklyn, but has become famous for his fight against the segregated school system in Brooklyn. Rev. Cleage, right here, is a Christian minister, here in Detroit, he's head of the Freedom Now Party. All of these are Christian ministers... all of these are Christian ministers but they don't come to us as Christian ministers, they come to us as fighters in some other category.
343	Adjudicated	Neutral	Eight months ago, we adopted a new strategy to meet that objective, including a surge in U.S. forces that reached full strength in June. This week, General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker testified before Congress about how that strategy is progressing. In their testimony, these men made clear that our challenge in Iraq is formidable. Yet they concluded that conditions in Iraq are improving, that we are seizing the initiative from the enemy, and that the troop surge is working. The premise of our strategy is that securing the Iraqi population is the foundation for all other progress. For Iraqis to bridge sectarian divides, they need to feel safe in their homes and neighborhoods. For lasting reconciliation to take root, Iraqis must feel confident that they do not need sectarian gangs for security. The goal of the surge is to provide that security and to help prepare Iraqi forces to maintain it. As I will explain tonight, our success in meeting these objectives now allows us to begin bringing some of our troops home.
12	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	It's not enough for us to view this as some remote event in which we, ourselves, are not involved. For our friends in Lebanon and Israel, for our friends in Europe and elsewhere in the Middle East, and for us as Americans, this tragedy, horrible as it is, reminds us of the absolute imperative of bringing peace to that troubled country and region. The people of Lebanon must have learned that the cycle of massacre upon massacre must end. Children are not avenged by the murder of other children. Israel must have learned that there is no way it can impose its own solutions on hatreds as deep and bitter as those that produced this tragedy. The participation of American forces in Beirut will again be for a limited period. But I've concluded there is no alternative to their returning to Lebanon if that country is to have a chance to stand on its own feet.
87	Adjudicated	Optimistic	Hi, I'm Gwen Moore and it's my honor to represent Milwaukee in Congress and to kick off the 2020 Democratic Convention. Oh, I sure wish you all were here in the city of Milwaukee which takes its name from the languages of the first peoples — interpreted as good land and gathering place by the waters. This is a city where blood was shed for labor rights, where a fugitive slave was freed from prison, where women's right to vote was first ratified. But today we gather virtually, however we gather unified in spirit, unified in our values and purpose to heal divisions and together move the nation confidently into a prosperous inclusive future. What better way to gather than all across America, to nominate my beloved friend Joe Biden to be 46th president of the United States of America with my VIP, VP nominee, sister, Kamala Harris by his side. Tonight, we are gathered to reclaim the soul of America. So, if you're ready to come together America, text “join” to 303-30. Thank you, I love you all and God bless you.
181	Adjudicated	Neutral	I want to thank my family. You guys all see Bryon standing here [cheers] Him and the kids have walked every step of this journey with me my entire life. When Brian married me, I was going to be a farmer and a rancher my whole life, and he got a little bit more than what he bargained for. But my goodness, he has been an absolute rock star and I thank God every day that he had the wisdom to give me Bryon Noem as a husband. [applause] I think sometimes these races are hardest on moms. So my mom is behind me and so is my mother-in-law, Sharon, and they're probably the two most wonderful women you'd ever meet in your entire life. And I want to thank them for just being willing to put their hearts out there and love us through the difficult days and celebrate on the fun days and just being there.
281	Adjudicated	Neutral	The functions of our government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington which had to be evacuated today are reopening for essential personnel tonight, and will be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong, and the American economy will be open for business, as well. The search is underway for those who are behind these evil acts. I've directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.
499	Adjudicated	Optimistic	My fellow Americans, tonight we come together to write a new chapter in the American story. Our forebears enshrined the American dream: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Every generation of Americans has worked to strengthen that legacy, to make our country a place of freedom and opportunity, a place where people who work hard can rise to their full potential, a place where their children can have a better future. From the settling of the frontier to the landing on the Moon, ours has been a continuous story of challenges defined, obstacles overcome, new horizons secured. That is what makes America what it is and Americans what we are. Now we are in a time of profound change and opportunity. The end of the cold war, the information age, the global economy have brought us both opportunity and hope and strife and uncertainty. Our purpose in this dynamic age must be to make change our friend and not our enemy.
424	Adjudicated	Optimistic	It is also fitting that we are joined today by the woman after whom this bill is named – someone Michelle and I have had the privilege of getting to know for ourselves. Lilly Ledbetter didn’t set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She was just a good hard worker who did her job – and did it well – for nearly two decades before discovering that for years, she was paid less than her male colleagues for the very same work. Over the course of her career, she lost more than $200,000 in salary, and even more in pension and Social Security benefits – losses she still feels today. Now, Lilly could have accepted her lot and moved on. She could have decided that it wasn’t worth the hassle and harassment that would inevitably come with speaking up for what she deserved. But instead, she decided that there was a principle at stake, something worth fighting for. So she set out on a journey that would take more than ten years, take her all the way to the Supreme Court, and lead to this bill which will help others get the justice she was denied. 
249	Adjudicated	Neutral	“Be not afraid.” They were the first words at the first public address of the first Polish Pope after his election on October of 1978. They were words that would come to define Pope John Paul II. Words that would change the world. John Paul brought the message here to Warsaw in his first trip back home as Pope in June of 1979. It was a message about the power—the power of faith, the power of resilience, and the power of the people. 
270	Adjudicated	Optimistic	Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I take great joy in making this announcement. It's going to be one of the most important initiatives that my administration not only discusses, but implements. First, it's good to have so many groups represented here -- religious and non-religious; Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Muslim; foundations and other non-profits. I want to thank you all for coming.
255	Adjudicated	Optimistic	To all the other elected officials and outstanding leaders who are here.  And to the whole Namaste family and Mr. Jones for outstanding work, congratulations.  Give them a big round of applause. (Applause.)  And to the best Vice President that we've had in a long time -- Joe Biden.  (Applause.) It is great to be back in Denver.  (Applause.)  I was here last summer -- we had a good time -- (laughter) -- to accept the nomination of my party and to make a promise to people of all parties that I would do all that I could to give every American the chance to make of their lives what they will; to see their children climb higher than they did.  And I'm back today to say that we have begun the difficult work of keeping that promise.  We have begun the essential work of keeping the American Dream alive in our time.  And that's why we're here today.  (Applause.)
283	Adjudicated	Neutral	Kosovo is a province of Serbia, in the middle of southeastern Europe, about 160 miles east of Italy. That's less than the distance between Washington and New York and only about 70 miles north of Greece. Its people are mostly ethnic Albanian and mostly Muslim. In 1989 Serbia's leader, Slobodan Milosevic, the same leader who started the wars in Bosnia and Croatia and moved against Slovenia in the last decade, stripped Kosovo of the constitutional autonomy its people enjoyed, thus denying them their right to speak their language, run their schools, shape their daily lives. For years, Kosovars struggled peacefully to get their rights back. When President Milosevic sent his troops and police to crush them, the struggle grew violent.
215	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	Success is somebody else’s failure. Success is the American Dream we can keep dreaming because most people in most places, including thirty million of ourselves, live wide awake in the terrible reality of poverty. No, I do not wish you success. I don’t even want to talk about it. I want to talk about failure. Because you are human beings you are going to meet failure. You are going to meet disappointment, injustice, betrayal, and irreparable loss. You will find you’re weak where you thought yourself strong. You’ll work for possessions and then find they possess you. You will find yourself -- as I know you already have -- in dark places, alone, and afraid.
163	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	We are Virginia Tech. We do not understand this tragedy. We know we did nothing to deserve it, but neither does the child in Africa dying of AIDS; neither do the invisible children walking the night away to avoid being captured by a rogue army; neither does the baby elephant watching his community be devastated for ivory; neither does the Mexican child looking for fresh water; neither does a Appalachian infant killed in the middle of the night in his crib in the home his father built with his own hands being run over by a boulder because the land was destabilized. No one deserves a tragedy.
106	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	I have spent an enormous amount of time in the last 12 years in the factories and businesses of this country talking to employers and employees, watching the way people work, often working with them. And I know that men and women are more productive when they are sure they won't lose their jobs because they're trying to be good parents, good children. Our businesses should not lose the services of these dedicated Americans. And over the long run, the lessons of the most productive companies in the world, here at home and around the world, are that those who put their people first are those who will triumph in the global economy. The business leaders who have already instituted family and medical leave understand this, and I'm very proud of some of the business leaders who are here today who represent not only themselves but others all across America who were ahead of all of us who make laws in doing what is right by our families.
340	Adjudicated	Neutral	I guess you know that I have just come from Geneva and talks with General Secretary Gorbachev. In the past few days, the past 2 days, we spent over 15 hours in various meetings with the General Secretary and the members of his official party. And approximately 5 of those hours were talks between Mr. Gorbachev and myself, just one on one. That was the best part—our fireside summit. There will be, I know, a great deal of commentary and opinion as to what the meetings produced and what they were like. There were over 3,000 reporters in Geneva, so it's possible there will be 3,000 opinions on what happened. So, maybe it's the old broadcaster in me, but I decided to file my own report directly to you. We met, as we had to meet. I called for a fresh start, and we made that start. I can't claim that we had a meeting of the minds on such fundamentals as ideology or national purpose, but we understand each other better, and that's a key to peace. I gained a better perspective; I feel he did, too. It was a constructive meeting; so constructive, in fact, that I look forward to welcoming Mr. Gorbachev to the United States next year. And I have accepted his invitation to go to Moscow the following year. We arranged that out in the parking lot. I found Mr. Gorbachev to be an energetic defender of Soviet policy. He was an eloquent speaker and a good listener.
292	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	"Now, I mean, something has gone terribly wrong when one speaker says ""vote your conscience"" and gets booed. I mean, I never thought I would say these words, but Ted Cruz was right. In this election, do the right thing and vote your conscience—vote for your future; vote for a United States of America. Now, look, I think many of us felt that those speakers, including of course their nominee, were not talking about the country we know and love. They weren't talking about the work people do every day, the opportunities we try to seize, neighbors helping neighbors. I didn't hear any of that. Instead, I heard about Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision. Last night's speech took it to a whole new level. He offered a lot of fear and anger and resentment, but no solutions about anything that he even talked about."
218	Adjudicated	Optimistic	I will not let that happen, I am not letting that happen, stick with me, continue to stand with the CFO legislation, and we will win for our children, who so desperately need good news. We continue to work hard on an issue which is just as important for our survival as fixing our fiscal crisis - crime. We have brought millions of additional dollars in. And because I have worked hard, I earned a seat on the Homeland Security committee, and am working to bring even more resources to the territory for law enforcement.
35	Adjudicated	Neutral	"In 1987 the French police found a large cache of explosives buried in a secret place in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris.¹ They staked out the cache and arrested some men who came to pick up these explosives. The French Minister of Interior called me that afternoon and said, ""Mr. Ambassador, you better come over to Paris right away. I have to tell you about this arrest we made."" So I flew over that night and the next morning he told me that these men had admitted to being members of Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist group, and that they were going to use these explosives in casual -- in attacks trying to kill many, many Frenchmen. But what was interesting was not that. It was their objective. Their stated objective was to create the Islamic Republic of France -- the Islamic Republic of France. Now, in 1987 this struck me as something of a fantastic idea. But, in fact, these men -- though I didn't know it at that time -- represented the face of the new terrorism that the National Commission reported on. By way of background, the old terrorists, the people we fought in the 70's and 80's were groups of men who used terrorism as a tactical device to draw attention to their cause. They didn't want to kill a lot of people. They just wanted to kill enough to get [in] the newspapers there, so they could talk about their objectives. In effect, the old terrorists practiced self-restraint in the number of people they killed."
399	Adjudicated	Neutral	The last time that I came to this Stadium was 22 years ago, when I visited it in November of 1940 as a student at a nearby small school for the game with Stanford. And we got a--I must say I had a much warmer reception today than I did from my Coast friends here on that occasion. In those days we used to fill these universities for football, and now we do it for academic events, and I'm not sure that this doesn't represent a rather dangerous trend for the future of our country. I am delighted to be here on this occasion for though it is the 94th anniversary of the Charter, in a sense this is the hundredth anniversary. For this university and so many other universities across our country owe their birth to the most extraordinary piece of legislation which this country has ever adopted, and that is the Morrill Act, signed by President Abraham Lincoln in the darkest and most uncertain days of the Civil War, which set before the country the opportunity to build the great land-grant colleges, of which this is so distinguished a part. Six years later, this university obtained its Charter.
299	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	"You won't need anything in the record when I finish telling you this. Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty, or your recklessness. Fred Fisher is a young man who went to the Harvard Law School and came into my firm and is starting what looks to be a brilliant career with us. When I decided to work for this committee, I asked Jim St. Clair, who sits on my right, to be my first assistant. I said to Jim, ""Pick somebody in the firm to work under you that you would like."" He chose Fred Fisher, and they came down on an afternoon plane. That night, when we had taken a little stab at trying to see what the case is about, Fred Fisher and Jim St. Clair and I went to dinner together. I then said to these two young men, ""Boys, I don't know anything about you except I've always liked you. But if there's anything funny in the life of either one of you that would hurt anybody in this case, you speak up quick."""
273	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	This year, the choice for Americans is between a man who values these ideals and all that can be built because of them and a man who isn’t guided by these ideals and coincidentally has built nothing. Remember, America’s battle for independence and fight for self-governance was something that had never been done before. Men of great intellect and wisdom like James Madison, the Father of our Constitution, hoped our constitutional republic would last for ages, mitigate the problems that would naturally arise from political factions, and prevent tyranny.
147	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	I am honored to support President Trump for re-election because I know that he is the only candidate who will stand up for hard-working families and protect the American dream for future generations. Since his first day in office, President Trump has fought tirelessly to deliver results for all Americans. Despite the democrats baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media's endless obsession with it, I was proud to lead the effort standing up for the Constitution, President Trump, and most importantly, the American people. This attack was not just on the President, it was an attack on you, your voice, and your vote. But the American people were not swayed by these partisan attacks. Our support for President Trump is stronger than ever before, we know what's at stake in this historic election. Americans from all walks of life are unified in support of our President, it's why more Republican women than ever are running for office this year. We understand that this election is a choice between the far-left democratic socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American dream. President Trump is working to safely reopen our main street economy, he understands that the engine of our country is fueled by the ingenuity and determination of American workers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses. Joe Biden wants to keep them locked up in the basement and crush them with four trillion dollars in new taxes. We face a critical choice; Joe Biden's far left failed policies of the past 47 years, or President Trump, who will stand up for the American people and the Constitution. I believe in the wisdom and spirit of the American people to elect the only candidate who is capable of protecting the American dream: President Donald J. Trump. Thank you to the north country for the opportunity to serve as your voice supporting his re-election. God bless the United States of America, the greatest country on earth.
184	Adjudicated	Optimistic	First, I want to thank my family. You don’t get into these races without a great, great support group, an incredible support group. After we’re done, I want all my family to come up and wave one last goodbye and say thank you to these incredible volunteers and the incredible people we have here. I am so proud of my family, so proud of the contributions they make every day to the people of North Dakota and the work they do. They really are incredible. The second group I want to thank is this incredible campaign staff. We knew when we started out this was a big headwind. It’s interesting when people say, well, so and so is going to have a tough time because they were in a plus eight districts, I said, I am in a plus 36 district. We knew it was going to be a tough headwind. And we knew we took some votes that a lot of people would criticize.
151	Adjudicated	Neutral	It was 45 years ago today that my father's funeral was held. I was a young girl at the age of 17 when my father was murdered by a white man in Baker County. In Baker County, the murder of black people occurred periodically, and in every case the white men who murdered them were never punished. It was no different in my father's case. There were three witnesses to his murder, but the grand jury refused to indict the white man who murdered him. I should tell you a little about Baker County. In case you don't know where it is, it's located less than 20 miles southwest of Albany. Now, there were two sheriffs from Baker County that -- whose names you probably never heard but I know in the case of one, the thing he did many, many years ago still affect us today. And that sheriff was Claude Screws. Claude Screws lynched a black man. And this was at the beginning of the 40s. And the strange thing back then was an all-white federal jury convicted him not of murder but of depriving Bobby Hall -- and I should say that Bobby Hall was a relative -- depriving him of his civil rights. So, in the opinion, when the justice wrote his opinion and justifying overturning the conviction, he said you had to prove that as the sheriff was murdering Bobby Hall he was thinking of depriving him of his civil rights. That's where the whole issue of proving intent came from and you heard it a lot. It was used a lot during the Civil Rights Movement. What you also heard a lot when Rodney King was beaten out in California. Y'all might remember that. They kept saying you had to prove intent -- and that came from Screws vs. the U.S. Government.
357	Adjudicated	Neutral	From the beginning of our administration, we've taken strong steps to do something about this horror. Tonight I can report to you that we've made much progress. Thirty-seven federal agencies are working together in a vigorous national effort, and by next year our spending for drug law enforcement will have more than tripled from its 1981 levels. We have increased seizures of illegal drugs. Shortages of marijuana are now being reported. Last year alone over 10,000 drug criminals were convicted and nearly $250 million of their assets were seized by the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration. And in the most important area, individual use, we see progress. In 4 years the number of high school seniors using marijuana on a daily basis has dropped from 1 in 14 to 1 in 20. The U.S. military has cut the use of illegal drugs among its personnel by 67 percent since 1980. These are a measure of our commitment and emerging signs that we can defeat this enemy. But we still have much to do.
373	Adjudicated	Optimistic	"In Bunyan's ""Pilgrim's Progress"" you may recall the description of the Man with the Muck Rake, the man who could look no way but downward, with the muck rake in his hand; who was offered a celestial crown for his muck rake, but who would neither look up nor regard the crown he was offered, but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor. In ""Pilgrim's Progress"" the Man with the Muck Rake is set forth as the example of him whose vision is fixed on carnal instead of spiritual things. Yet he also typifies the man who in this life consistently refuses to see aught that is lofty, and fixes his eyes with solemn intentness only on that which is vile and debasing."
227	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	While the so-called religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight, I want to emphasize from the outset that I believe that we have far more critical issues in the 1960 campaign; the spread of Communist influence, until it now festers only 90 miles from the coast of Florida -- the humiliating treatment of our President and Vice President by those who no longer respect our power -- the hungry children I saw in West Virginia, the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills, the families forced to give up their farms -- an America with too many slums, with too few schools, and too late to the moon and outer space. These are the real issues which should decide this campaign. And they are not religious issues -- for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier.
404	Adjudicated	Neutral	This election will not mean the end of violence. But it is the beginning of something new: constitutional democracy at the heart of the Middle East. And this vote -- 6,000 miles away, in a vital region of the world -- means that America has an ally of growing strength in the fight against terror. All who had a part in this achievement -- Iraqis, and Americans and our coalition partners -- can be proud. Yet our work is not done. There is more testing and sacrifice before us. I know many Americans have questions about the cost and direction of this war. So tonight I want to talk to you about how far we have come in Iraq, and the path that lies ahead.
359	Adjudicated	Neutral	My administration must decide whether to allow federal funds, your tax dollars, to be used for scientific research on stem cells derived from human embryos.  A large number of these embryos already exist.  They are the product of a process called in vitro fertilization, which helps so many couples conceive children.  When doctors match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb, they usually produce more embryos than are planted in the mother.  Once a couple successfully has children, or if they are unsuccessful, the additional embryos remain frozen in laboratories. Some will not survive during long storage; others are destroyed.  A number have been donated to science and used to create privately funded stem cell lines.  And a few have been implanted in an adoptive mother and born, and are today healthy children.
314	Adjudicated	Optimistic	Now, we are here at the home of the UFCW Local 324. I want to thank Greg Conger and Rick Eiden and Greg … for welcoming us here, and all of the UFCW family. And thank Andrea Zinder for appearing on the free program. Thanks also to Art Brown and everybody from Buena Park who has made us so welcome. And mostly, I want to thank all of you. One of the great things about campaigning across the country is to stand where I'm standing and look out at this audience and audiences like it, and really see America. Seeing what we are as a nation—I have this old-fashioned idea that we are stronger together. Stronger together when we make the economy work for everybody, not just those at the top. Stronger together when we knock down all the barriers that stand in the way of any American getting ahead and staying ahead.
223	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	"When I first addressed you from here, our national defenses were dangerously weak, we had suffered humiliation in Iran, and at home we were adrift, possibly because of a failure here in Washington to trust the courage and character of you, the people. But worst of all, we were on the brink of economic collapse from years of government overindulgence and abusive overtaxation. Thus, I had to report that we were ""in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression."" Inflation had risen to over 13 percent in 1979 and to 19 percent in March of 1980. Those back-to-back years of price explosions were the highest in more than 60 years. In the five years before I came here, taxes had actually doubled. Your cost-of-living pay raises just bumped you into higher tax brackets."
320	Adjudicated	Neutral	So I'm one of those lucky ten percenters to beat the odds. I went to UCLA undergrad and then USC for law school. I've gotten a piece of the American dream, but now I'm running to make sure others have that same opportunity and that in a nutshell is why I'm running for Congress. Now I can tell you that when I was- when I was in college I walked into the career center one day and I said hey I see Washington on television all the time and I'm a political science major, maybe I could visit one day. And it was a counselor who said to me, “Nanette, you could do whatever you want,” and I said I have no political connections, my parents are not political donors, how would I ever get a job in Washington? And he said just apply.
305	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	You know, a big part of it is to think about all the people who turned their lives upside down to be a part of this campaign. All of the staffers who moved and worked long hours — gave up jobs to be here — took leaves from school — to think about what works for them. This isn’t just about me, this is a whole lot of people who were a big part of this — and also our volunteers — to try to think through. For all those people who already have invested so many hours and so much of their heart. And the phone calls and the door knocks and the coming to the office and help clean things up and keep it all going. And thinking about all those pinky promises, you know, I take those pinky promises seriously. So those were the things I needed to think through and how we make all those pieces work, at least as best we can for everyone. And one last thing, it’s about all the people who are affected by all the issues I’ve talked about, whether they got involved in my fight or someone else’s fight or even not at all. But however we talk about this, there’s still a trillion and a half dollars of student loan debt outstanding. There are still tens of millions of people across this country who, one bad medical diagnosis and they’re upside down financially. There are still mamas and daddies across this country who can’t finish their education, can’t take on jobs because they can’t find access to decent childcare that they can afford. And I had to think a lot about where is the best place for me to go to keep fighting those fights because those problems don’t disappear when I stand here in front of you, those problems go on. And my job is to keep fighting and to fight as smartly and effectively as I can. Thank you.
23	Adjudicated	Optimistic	Joe knows the fear military families live because he's felt that dread of never knowing if your deployed loved one is safe. He understands their bravery because he has had to muster that same strength every hour of every day Beau was overseas. That's the kind of leader our service members deserve. One who understands the risks they face and who would actually protect them by doing his job as commander-in-chief. Instead, they have a coward-in-chief who won't stand up to Vladimir Putin, read his daily intelligence briefings or even publicly admonish adversaries for reportedly putting bounties on our troops’ heads. As president, Joe Biden would never let tyrants manipulate him like a puppet, he would never pervert our military to stroke his own ego, he would never turn his back on our troops or threaten them against Americans peacefully exercising their constitutional rights. Joe Biden would stand up for what’s right, stand tall for our troops and stand strong against our enemies because unlike Trump, Joe Biden has common decency, he has common sense, he can command both from experience and from strength. Donald Trump doesn't deserve to call himself commander-in-chief for another four minutes, let alone another four years. Our troops deserve better, our country deserves better.
441	Adjudicated	Optimistic	You, the American people, have made our passage into the global information age an era of great American renewal. In all the work I have done as president, every decision I have made, every executive action I have taken, every bill I have proposed and signed, I've tried to give all Americans the tools and conditions to build the future of our dreams, in a good society, with a strong economy, a cleaner environment, and a freer, safer, more prosperous world. I have steered my course by our enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans. I have sought to give America a new kind of government, smaller, more modern, more effective, full of ideas and policies appropriate to this new time, always putting people first, always focusing on the future. Working together, America has done well. Our economy is breaking records, with more than 22 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the highest home ownership ever, the longest expansion in history.
13	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	Events in Iraq have now reached the final days of decision... Since then, the world has engaged in 12 years of diplomacy. We have passed more than a dozen resolutions in the United Nations Security Council. We have sent hundreds of weapons inspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq. Our good faith has not been returned. The danger is clear: using chemical, biological or, one day, nuclear weapons, obtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country, or any other.
37	Adjudicated	Optimistic	"In a much larger view, SNCC says that white America cannot condemn herself. And since we are liberal, we have done it: You stand condemned. Now, a number of things that arises from that answer of how do you condemn yourselves. Seems to me that the institutions that function in this country are clearly racist, and that they're built upon racism. And the question, then, is how can black people inside of this country move? And then how can white people who say they’re not a part of those institutions begin to move? And how then do we begin to clear away the obstacles that we have in this society, that make us live like human beings? How can we begin to build institutions that will allow people to relate with each other as human beings? This country has never done that, especially around the country of white or black. Now, several people have been upset because we’ve said that integration was irrelevant when initiated by blacks, and that in fact it was a subterfuge, an insidious subterfuge, for the maintenance of white supremacy. Now we maintain that in the past six years or so, this country has been feeding us a ""thalidomide drug of integration,"" and that some negroes have been walking down a dream street talking about sitting next to white people; and that that does not begin to solve the problem; that when we went to Mississippi we did not go to sit next to Ross Barnett; we did not go to sit next to Jim Clark; we went to get them out of our way; and that people ought to understand that; that we were never fighting for the right to integrate, we were fighting against white supremacy."
293	Adjudicated	Neutral	When I came into your hall tonight, I thought of the last time I was in your city. Twenty-one years ago I came here with Susan B. Anthony, and we came for exactly the same purpose as that for which we are here tonight. Boys have been born since that time and have become voters, and the women are still trying to persuade American men to believe in the fundamental principles of democracy, and I never quite feel as if it was a fair field to argue this question with men, because in doing it you have to assume that a man who professes to believe in a Republican form of government does not believe in a Republican form of government, for the only thing that woman's enfranchisement means at all is that a government which claims to be a Republic should be a Republic, and not an aristocracy.
265	Adjudicated	Optimistic	"So, each one of us has a choice today: Will we defend this democracy? Will we speak out for what we believe in? Will we reject hate and fear, greed and corruption? Will we fight, with every fiber of our being, because everything we care about is at stake? Will we be brave? You've already answered that question just by being here today. And if you're with me - if you're ready to take on this fight - join my campaign by going to KIRSTENGILLIBRAND.COM and contribute to help power this movement forward. I believe, in my bones, that we can do this. And I know that years from now, we will look back on this moment in our history, and we'll be able to say that we did something about it. We stood up, locked arms, and proved to America and the world, that when people come together to drive out darkness... Hope rises. Fear loses. And, Brave wins. Thank you. God Bless you all. And God bless America!"""
460	Adjudicated	Optimistic	I offer my appreciation to Mayor Andrew Young who has provided such gracious hospitality to all of us this week. And a special salute to President Jimmy Carter. President Carter restored honor to the White House after Watergate. He gave many of us a special opportunity to grow. For his kind words, for his unwavering commitment to peace in the world, and for the voters that came from his family, every member of his family, led by Billy and Amy, I offer my special thanks to the Carter family.
246	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	Public servants promised to defend our Constitution uphold our laws and work on behalf of the American people. But from the moment President Trump took office, he's used his position to benefit himself rather than our country. He's trampled the rule of law, trying to weaponize our justice department to attack his enemies and protect his friends. Rather than standing up to Vladimir Putin, he fawns over a dictator who is still trying to interfere in our elections. He's even trying to sabotage our postal service to keep people from being able to vote. His constant attacks on the FBI, the free press, inspectors general, federal judges — they all have one purpose: to remove any check on his abuse of power. Put simply, he treats our country like it's his family business, this time bankrupting our nation's moral authority at home and abroad. But our country doesn't belong to him, it belongs to all of us.
31	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	"This Republican Administration treats us as if we were pieces of a puzzle that can’t fit together. They've tried to put us into compartments and separate us from each other. Their political theory is “divide and conquer.” They’ve suggested time and time again that what is of interest to one group of Americans is not of interest to any one else. We’ve been isolated. We’ve been lumped into that sad phraseology called “special interests.” They’ve told farmers that they were selfish, that they would drive up food prices if they asked the government to intervene on behalf of the family farm, and we watched farms go on the auction block while we bought food from foreign countries. Well, that’s wrong! They told working mothers it’s all their fault -- their families are falling apart because they had to go to work to keep their kids in jeans and tennis shoes and college. And they’re wrong!! They told American labor they were trying to ruin free enterprise by asking for 60 days’ notice of plant closings, and that’s wrong. And they told the auto industry and the steel industry and the timber industry and the oil industry, companies being threatened by foreign products flooding this country, that you’re ""protectionist"" if you think the government should enforce our trade laws. And that is wrong. When they belittle us for demanding clean air and clean water for trying to save the oceans and the ozone layer, that’s wrong."
474	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	Because of trump 's failures of leaderships, our economy has taken one of the biggest hits out of all the major industrialized nations, with an unemployment rate that has tripled, as of today. This is what happens when we elect a guy, who just isn't up for the job. Our country ends up in tatters. And so does our reputation around the world. But let's be clear – this election is not just about defeating Donald Trump or Mike Pence. It's about building this country back, better. And that's exactly what Joe and I will do. We’ll create millions of jobs and fight climate change through a clean energy revolution; bring back critical supply chains, so the future is made in America. Build on the affordable care act so everyone has the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. And finally, offer caregivers the dignity, the respect, and the pay they deserve. We’ll protect a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body; root out systemic racism in our justice system; and pass a new Voting Rights Act – a John Lewis Voting Rights Act – that will insure every voice is heard and every voice is counted.
139	Adjudicated	Neutral	"In times like these it is immature -- and, incidentally, untrue -- for anybody to brag that an unprepared America, single-handed and with one hand tied behind its back, can hold off the whole world. No realistic American can expect from a dictator’s peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion -- or even good business.  Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors.  Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. As a nation we may take pride in the fact that we are soft-hearted; but we cannot afford to be soft-headed.  We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal preach the ""ism"" of appeasement.  We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests."
279	Adjudicated	Neutral	Having provided that summary, I would like to review the nature of the conflict in Iraq, recall the situation before the surge, describe the current situation, and explain the recommendations I have provided to my chain of command for the way ahead in Iraq. The fundamental source of the conflict in Iraq is competition among ethnic and sectarian communities for power and resources. This competition will take place, and its resolution is key to producing long-term stability in the new Iraq. The question is whether the competition takes place more -- or less -- violently. This chart shows the security challenges in Iraq.
100	Adjudicated	Optimistic	New Hampshire faces great challenges in the coming years to ensure that we are building a strong and vibrant economic future. From early results, it appears that the New Hampshire legislature will be nearly evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. We should see this not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to move beyond the partisan divide. Throughout this campaign, I have been strengthened and inspired by the hard work and creativity that Granite Staters use to solve problems. Whether it’s building a community playground, bringing cost-saving renewable energy to a high school or plowing our way out of a snowstorm – we work together to get things done.
144	Adjudicated	Optimistic	I met Jake Tsuitachi in Spokane who at 16, in his diabetic, worries about getting access to affordable health care that might bankrupt his family if he doesn't. I met longshoremen in Longview Washington who want to know why with a corporate tax break does people seem to care more about that than their living wage jobs. So I want everyone to know that I'm going to redouble my efforts to work across the aisle because we're going to try to have economic prosperity that reaches all parts of Washington State, and I believe that we can do this working together. So I am so excited by this opportunity, but I also want us to meet the challenge. I think working together so that we can address some of these issues, whether it's apprenticeships and skilling and training people for next generation jobs or helping to continue to make prescription drugs more affordable, that all of these things require us to work together, but every generation of Americans have met their challenge. Trust me, our history books are full of their stories. It's now our turn to write this story about working for economic prosperity for everyone in the state of Washington and everyone in the United States. So thank you for this unbelievable opportunity. Thank you for working so hard in Washington. Thank you for letting me bring in ideas of innovation and collaboration working together to the other Washington so we can continue to lead. Thank you.
83	Adjudicated	Optimistic	Good evening. Last week, the warring factions in Bosnia reached a peace agreement, as a result of our efforts in Dayton, Ohio, and the support of our European and Russian partners. Tonight, I want to speak with you about implementing the Bosnian peace agreement, and why our values and interests as Americans require that we participate. Let me say at the outset, America's role will not be about fighting a war. It will be about helping the people of Bosnia to secure their own peace agreement. Our mission will be limited, focused, and under the command of an American general. In fulfilling this mission, we will have the chance to help stop the killing of innocent civilians, especially children, and at the same time, to bring stability to Central Europe, a region of the world that is vital to our national interests. It is the right thing to do. From our birth, America has always been more than just a place. America has embodied an idea that has become the ideal for billions of people throughout the world. Our Founders said it best: America is about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In this century especially, America has done more than simply stand for these ideals. We have acted on them and sacrificed for them. Our people fought two World Wars so that freedom could triumph over tyranny. After World War I, we pulled back from the world, leaving a vacuum that was filled by the forces of hatred. After World War II, we continued to lead the world.
113	Adjudicated	Optimistic	We do not want in the United States a nation of spectators. We want a nation of participants in the vigorous life. This is not a matter which can be settled, of course, from Washington. It is really a matter which starts with each individual family. It is my hope that mothers and fathers, stretching across the United States, will be concerned about this phase of their children's development, that the communities will be concerned to make it possible for young boys and girls to participate actively in the physical life, and that men and women who have reached the age of maturity will concern themselves with maintaining their own participation in this phase of national vigor--national life. I am hopeful that we can develop here today, with your help and suggestions, a program which will inspire our country to be concerned. I don't think we have to read these tests which we have seen so much of during the last 10 years to realize that because of the generosity of nature, because of the way our society is organized, that there has been less emphasis on national vigor, national vitality, physical well-being, than there has been in many other countries of the world. I want to do better. And I think you want to do better. We want to make sure that as our life becomes more sophisticated, as we become more urbanized, that we don't lose this very valuable facet of our national character: physical vitality, which is tied into qualities of character, which is tied into qualities of intellectual vigor and vitality.
363	Adjudicated	Neutral	Like Donald Trump, I saw what was happening to our great country and I felt like I had no choice. Our nominee speaks to the American people in their capacity as citizens. They can be any race or religion, but they must in accepting the freedom and the protection that our nation provides, take on the obligations and the duties of citizenship. The whole notion sounds vaguely outdated too many ears, particularly those in the media and the political elites. We hear a lot these days about what everyone is entitled to especially what political correctness dictates we must say or do, but our nominee speaks to us as individuals, as citizens of the greatest country the world has ever known. And he wants to conserve the freedom and greatness of that country, and that I submit to you ladies and gentlemen, is the most conservative and the best work that can be done by anyone in this day in this country.
200	Adjudicated	Neutral	Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities as a Government or as a people. I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament. The fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight, nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy, yet we import more oil today than ever before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our Government, than ever before.
71	Adjudicated	Optimistic	We just made history. This- this is what history looks like. This is what coming together and moving forward feels like. Can you feel it? Tonight for the first time in our state's founding since 230 years ago, we are sending a woman and a person of color to Congress. I am humbled and honored to stand before you tonight and say we did it together. I said when I go to Washington, I'm representing a lot of different interests, people, perspectives, and I'm just really humbled and excited to go and serve. There was the “what” which is jobs in the economy and really focusing on things that will really help Delaware everything from building our infrastructure to dealing with issues like equal pay for equal work, to the “how” and part of that is what I want to talk about tonight that if we don't come together, we won't be able to deal with any of the problems. So what I hope to take to DC is also a positive spirit and bringing people together. We ran a great race. We just- you know, it's that blue wall, new castle county right? Yeah, so hey I'm proud to be … but I'm proud to be a Republican. I am a patriot all the way. I love America. We all need to do what's best for America. We will get through this. I called and congratulated Lisa, and God bless America.
118	Adjudicated	Neutral	Each decade during those past 50 years, real income per person in America rose an average of nearly 30 percent. And today, in America, we have taken—or things we take for granted that didn't even exist 50 years ago—television, computers, space flights, and so many more things, including the very means of travel—space or the jet travel brought me here to this country. Yes, hunger and sickness still exist in many parts of the world and in our own land. But thanks to breakthroughs in agriculture and medicine, today more people on Earth eat better and live longer than ever before in the history of our planet. As a matter of fact, I have lived some 20-odd years longer than my life expectancy when I was born. Now, that's a source of annoyance to a number of people in my own country.  But the key to all this progress has not been minerals, electricity, or building materials, but the human capacity for intelligence, imagination, and wonder and the opportunity to put all of them to use.
1	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	"I understand -- I understand the sense of frustration and despair in our country, because I know firsthand about shouting for help and getting no answer. I went to Washington to tell Presidents Reagan and Bush that much, much more had to be done for AIDS research and care, and that children couldn't be forgotten. The first time, when nothing happened, I thought, ""They just didn't hear me."" The second time, when nothing happened, I thought, ""Maybe I didn't shout loud enough."" But now I realize they don't hear because they don't want to listen. When you cry for help and no one listens, you start to lose your hope. I began to lose faith in America. I felt my country was letting me down -- and it was. This is not the America I was raised to be proud of. I was raised to believe that other's problems were my problems as well. But when I tell most people about HIV, in hopes that they will help and care, I see the look in their eyes: ""It's not my problem,"" they're thinking. Well, it's everyone's problem and we need a leader who will tell us that. We need a visionary to guide us -- to say it wasn't all right for Ryan White to be banned from school because he had AIDS, to say it wasn't alright for a man or a woman to be denied a job because they're infected with this virus. We need a leader who is truly committed to educating us."
393	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	During those first hours on bloody Omaha, nothing seemed to go right. Landing craft were ripped apart by mines and shells. Tanks sent to protect them had sunk, drowning their crews. Enemy fire raked the invaders as they stepped into chest-high water and waded past the floating bodies of their comrades. And as the stunned survivors of the first wave huddled behind a seawall, it seemed the invasion might fail. Hitler and his followers had bet on it. They were sure the Allied soldiers were soft, weakened by liberty and leisure, by the mingling of races and religion. They were sure their totalitarian youth had more discipline and zeal.
56	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	My parents would have given me anything they could, but they just didn't have the money to send me to college. The only way I could get to be a teacher was if I ended up at a commuter college that costs $50 a semester. It opened a million doors for me. The way I see it, I’m the daughter of a maintenance man, who ended up as a United States Senator. Hillary Clinton is the daughter of a factory worker, granddaughter of a factory worker. And she's going to be elected president. We believe in that America. That is the America we fight for. We believe, but we are worried. Worried that those opportunities are slipping away. In fact, a lot of America is worried. Worried and angry. Angry that far too often, Washington works for those at the top, and leaves everyone else behind. For 30 years now, republicans have pushed trickledown economics. They've done one thing -- they have helped the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful. They have stepped on the faces of everyone else who is trying to get a fighting chance to succeed. Donald trump a good game about how the game is rigged. Let's be clear. Donald trump is right. The game is rigged. It is rigged for guys like Donald trump. And I say it is time to fight back. Maggie says it is time to fight back, Hillary says it is time to fight back.
266	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	But the creators of national government were perforce ruthless men. They were often cruel in their methods, but they did strive steadily toward something that society needed and very much wanted, a strong central state, able to keep the peace, to stamp out civil war, to put the unruly nobleman in his place, and to permit the bulk of individuals to live safely. The man of ruthless force had his place in developing a pioneer country, just as he did in fixing the power of the central government in the development of nations. Society paid him well for his services and its development. When the development among the nations of Europe, however, has been completed, ambition, and ruthlessness, having served its term tended to overstep its mark. There came a growing feeling that government was conducted for the benefit of a few who thrived unduly at the expense of all. The people sought a balancing -- a limiting force. There came gradually, through town councils, trade guilds, national parliaments, by constitution and by popular participation and control, limitations on arbitrary power.
214	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	For more than 60 years, Marines have gone forth from Camp Lejeune to fight our country's battles. Now America has entered a fierce struggle to protect the world from a grave danger and to bring freedom to an oppressed people. As the forces of our coalition advance, we learn more about the atrocities of the Iraqi regime and the deep fear that Saddam Hussein has instilled in the Iraqi people. Yet, no scheme of this enemy, no crime of a dying regime will divert us from our mission. We will not stop until Iraq is free. When freedom needs defending, America turns to our military. And as they do their job, our men and women in uniform count on their families -- like you all here today. This is a time of hardship for many military families. Some of you have been separated from your loved ones for quite a while because of long deployments. All of America is grateful for your sacrifice. And Laura and I are here to thank each one of you.
498	Adjudicated	Neutral	"Where four decades ago there was rubble, today in West Berlin there is the greatest industrial output of any city in Germany—busy office blocks, fine homes and apartments, proud avenues, and the spreading lawns of park land. Where a city's culture seemed to have been destroyed, today there are two great universities, orchestras and an opera, countless theaters, and museums. Where there was want, today there's abundance—food, clothing, automobiles—the wonderful goods of the Ku'damm. From devastation, from utter ruin, you Berliners have, in freedom, rebuilt a city that once again ranks as one of the greatest on Earth. The Soviets may have had other plans. But, my friends, there were a few things the Soviets didn't count on Berliner herz, Berliner humor, ja, und Berliner schnauze. [Berliner heart, Berliner humor, yes, and a Berliner schnauze.] [Laughter] In the 1950s, Khrushchev predicted: ""We will bury you."" But in the West today, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history. In the Communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind—too little food. Even today, the Soviet Union still cannot feed itself. After these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: Freedom leads to prosperity. Freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among the nations with comity and peace. Freedom is the victor."
242	Adjudicated	Neutral	Change has become the watchword of this year's electioneering. Candidates contend with each other, arguing, debating -- which of them is the authentic agent of change. Such jostling acquires substance when we comprehend the public mind. There appears to be a general apprehension about the future which undermines our confidence in ourselves and each other. The American idea that tomorrow will be better than today has become de-stabilized by a stubborn, sluggish economy. Jobs lost have become permanent unemployment rather than cyclical unemployment. Public policy makers are held in low regard. Mistrust abounds. Given such an environment, is it not understandable that the prevailing issue of this political season is identifying the catalyst for change that is required? I see that catalyst as: the Democratic Party and its nominee for President.
160	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	That's just a start. We’ve got to fight for a fair economy and fix the student loan program, make sure we get down those costs. We have to protect Social Security and Medicare. I think you know the Republicans have had a target on those vital programs because they see them as a way to fix the deficit that they have created by giving big tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations. So we have our work cut out for us.
386	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	When it comes to the border, this is truly a dereliction of duty. I mean, this is a national security threat like no other. When I was governor in South Carolina, we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country. President Obama sued us over it and we won. We will take what we did in South Carolina and go national with it. We did a e-verify program that required businesses to have to prove that the people they hire are in this country legally. We will defund sanctuary cities once and for all, no more safe havens for illegal immigrants. We'll put 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. And then we'll go back to the remain in Mexico policy so that no one even steps foot on US soil and instead of catch and release, we'll do catch and deport. We've got to send them back. We've got to stop the incentive that's allowing, that's causing them to come in the first place.
40	Adjudicated	Neutral	Judge Barrett is a graduate of Rhodes College and the University of Notre Dame Law School. At Notre Dame, she earned a full academic scholarship, served as the Executive Editor of the Law Review, graduated first in her class, and received the law school’s award for the best record of scholarship and achievement. Upon graduation, she became a clerk for Judge Laurence Silberman on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Amy then received one of the highest honors a young lawyer could have, serving as a clerk on the Supreme Court for Justice Antonin Scalia. A highly, a very highly respected law professor at Notre Dame wrote to Justice Scalia with a one-sentence recommendation: “Amy Coney is the best student I ever had.” That’s pretty good. Justice Scalia hired her shortly thereafter.
322	Adjudicated	Neutral	The President. If any situation should arise that would require my presence here, naturally I will do that. So, that will be a decision that awaits what's going to happen. May I just—because I have to be back in there for another appointment—may I just say one thing on top of this? With all this talk of penalties and everything else, I hope that you'll emphasize, again, the possibility of termination, because I believe that there are a great many of those people—and they're fine people—who have been swept up in this and probably have not really considered the result—the fact that they had taken an oath, the fact that this is now in violation of the law, as that one supervisor referred to with regard to his children. And I am hoping that they will in a sense remove themselves from the lawbreaker situation by returning to their posts.
117	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, my fellow leaders, in the last year, our world has experienced great upheaval: a growing crisis in food insecurity; record heat, floods, and droughts; COVID-19; inflation; and a brutal, needless war—a war chosen by one man, to be very blunt. Let us speak plainly. A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map.  Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter—no more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force. Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime. Now Russia is calling—calling up more soldiers to join the fight. And the Kremlin is organizing a sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the U.N. Charter. 
311	Adjudicated	Optimistic	But they’ve become very good friends, and we’re now in battle together and in friendship together. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Applause.) Thank you, Mitch. Great guy. (Applause.) That was a big win we had, Mitch. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. John, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Again, Steve, thank you. (Applause.) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin. (Applause.) Chair John Thune and House Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers. (Applause.) Did they forget your name, John? I don’t know. What’s going on here? (Laughter.) John Cornyn, everybody knows. They didn’t put his name up, but that’s okay. That’s the first time that’s ever happened. Hey, John, that will never happen again. (Laughter.)
254	Adjudicated	Optimistic	Tonight we come together bound by our faith in a mighty God, with genuine respect and love for our country, and inheriting the legacy of a great Party, the Democratic Party, which is the best hope for redirecting our nation on a more humane, just, and peaceful course. This is not a perfect party. We are not a perfect people. Yet, we are called to a perfect mission. Our mission: to feed the hungry; to clothe the naked; to house the homeless; to teach the illiterate; to provide jobs for the jobless; and to choose the human race over the nuclear race.
288	Adjudicated	Optimistic	Yes! But I'm going to start with a few thank you’s. First of all I want to thank Ludmill. I mean are all you student like her? She’s amazing and I know you all are too. Let’s give her a round of applause. I also want to recognize you are your U.S. Senate candidate. Katie McGinty. Katie’s here. Your U.S. House of Representatives candidate Dwight Evans. Your candidate for attorney general Josh Shapiro. Your state senator Art Haywood, and city councilwoman Cindy bass. I know you all heard from them earlier today. So let's thank them for being here and let's wish them luck on the future. We're going to get a lot of things got done, but most of all I want to thank all of you here at LaSalle University. I have heard some great things about the school and about the students and staff, so I am so proud I am honored to be here.
29	Adjudicated	Neutral	Our progress -- our progress is measured day by day, terrorist by terrorist. We recently apprehended one of al Qaeda's top leaders, a man named Abu Zabaydah. He was spending a lot of time as one of the top operating officials of al Qaeda, plotting and planning murder. He's not plotting and he's not planning anymore. He's under lock and key, and we're going to give him some company. We're hunting down the killers one by one. We're learning a lot about al Qaeda operations and their plans. As our enemies have fled their hideouts in Afghanistan, they left some things behind. We found laptop computers, drawings and maps. And through them, we're gaining a clearer picture of the terrorist targets and their methods. Our international coalition against these killers is strong and united and acting. European nations have frozen almost $50 million in suspected terrorist assets, and that's important. Many European states are taking aggressive and effective law enforcement action to join us in rounding up these terrorists and their cells. We're making good progress. Yet, it's important for Americans to know this war will not be quick and this war will not be easy. The first phase of our military operation was in Afghanistan, where our armed forces continue to perform with bravery and with skill. You've got to understand that as we routed out the Taliban, they weren't sent in to conquer; they were sent in to liberate. And they succeeded. And our military makes us proud. The battles in Afghanistan are not over. American and allied troops are taking risks today in what we call Operation Mountain Lion -- hunting down the al Qaeda and Taliban forces, and keeping them on the run. Coalition naval forces, in the largest combined flotilla since World War II, are patrolling escape routes and intercepting ships to search for terrorists and their supplies.
206	Adjudicated	Optimistic	So now is the time for our country to come together, to have faith in our democracy, to believe that at its core our elected officials who share the same values that have governed this country since its birth. Because now is the time that we must challenge ourselves to do better, to resolve our differences, to realize that in this country we are at our best when our leaders lead with compassion, commitment and courage. We know that doing what is right, doing what is just, is never a partisan issue.
295	Adjudicated	Optimistic	I understand the skepticism in this community about any policy of engagement toward Cuba. As many of you know, I've been skeptical too. But you've been promised progress for fifty years. And we can't wait any longer for a failed policy to bear fruit. We have to seize this moment. We have to now support change on an island where it is desperately needed. I did not come to this position lightly. I well remember what happened to previous attempts at engagement. In the 1990s, Castro responded to quiet diplomacy by shooting down the unarmed Brothers to the Rescue plane out of the sky. And with their deaths in mind, I supported the Helms-Burton Act to tighten the embargo.
478	Adjudicated	Optimistic	We’re working on a summit.  And you know all about the summit.  It will be in Vietnam — Hanoi.  And we will — we’ll be meeting in Hanoi.  We’ll be meeting in Hanoi.  I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.  And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.  A lot was done in the first summit.  No more rockets going up.  No more missiles going up.  No more testing of nuclear.  Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.  And we got back our hostages. But we hope we’re going to be very much equally as successful.  I’m in no rush for speed.  We just don’t want testing.  The sanctions, as you know, remain.  Everything is remaining.  China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.  And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we’ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan. But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing.  And that’s okay — as per the United Nations.
493	Adjudicated	Optimistic	This past year women learned that when we aren't at the table, we're on the menu. So this November, women are organizing, we're mobilizing and we're voting for the leaders who fight for us. Nearly 100 years ago, when Planned Parenthood was founded, birth control was illegal. And as a result, few women had the opportunity to finish school. We weren't even expected to live much past the age 50. But times have changed. Today, we are mothers, and we are teachers and scientists and accountants and members of the armed forces. And because of President Barak Obama, more women than ever are serving in the Cabinet and on the United States Supreme Court. We've come so far.
28	Adjudicated	Neutral	He must learn them again. He must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid; and, teaching himself that, forget it forever, leaving no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed -- love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writes not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but of the glands. Until he relearns these things, he will write as though he stood among and watched the end of man. I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last ding-dong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.
345	Adjudicated	Optimistic	When I think about the secretary of state race the thing that ties all of those other races together and all the issues that are so important to us, is the vote. And if you imagine our democracy being a door, the key of our democracy and the vote – the person who holds that key is our secretary of state. And I'm convinced we need to turn over those keys. I'm excited about the enthusiasm that I feel as I'm traveling throughout the state, and I'm so happy that I have an opportunity to run for secretary of state. Anybody wanting to do business in our state, has to go through the secretary of state's office first, if they don't they can't get a bank account. And so, we know that, that is a gateway to connect with our small business owners. Right now, that office is more like a rubber stamp – taking people's articles stamping them, quadrupling their fees, and literally saying ‘go about your business’ with those actions.
353	Adjudicated	Optimistic	I've known the darkest of days. Days of pain and uncertain recovery. But confronted by despair, I've summoned hope. Confronted by paralysis anesthesia, I responded with grit and determination. I put one foot in front of the other, I found one word and then I found another. My recovery is a daily fight but fighting makes me stronger. Words once came easily, today I struggle to speak but I have not lost my voice. America needs all of us to speak out, even when you have to fight to find the words. We are at a crossroads; we can let the shooting continue or we can act. We can protect our families, our future, we can vote, we can be on the right side of history. We must elect Joe Biden. He was there for me; he'll be there for you too. Join us in this fight. Vote, vote, vote. Thank you very much.
133	Adjudicated	Optimistic	I have been so fortunate to be surrounded by so many wonderful people—people on our campaign staff and thousands of volunteers. If you all knew the number of people who have made phone calls in the last four days, in the last few weeks.... If you knew the number of people who probably need to buy new tennis shoes because they've walked so many doors and dropped literature, it would warm your heart as much as it does mine. I want to thank all of our campaign workers, all of my campaign staff. You have sustained me, you have energized me, you have inspired me, and I can tell you this: I know, without a shadow of doubt, that your commitment, those of you that are here, your commitment has been deep, it has been strong, and it has been personal. And your trust in me, and your faith in me, is something that no one can ever take away. I am a richer person for having been in this position. I will be a better Oklahoman because of your belief in me.
302	Adjudicated	Optimistic	What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another; and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black. So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King -- yeah, it's true -- but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love -- a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke.
190	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	I want to be very clear. I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement. Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacred traditions and values.  Mob violence goes against everything I believe in, and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans. If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement. You are attacking it, and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it. Tragically, over the course of the past year, made so difficult because of covid-19, we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop, whether you are on the right or on the left, a democrat or a republican, there is never a justification for violence. No excuses. No exceptions. 
385	Adjudicated	Optimistic	And most importantly to our volunteers, and I see so many of you out there. You delivered every day, rain or shine. You knocked doors, you made calls, you put up signs, you brought your friends and your families to the polls. So I want to tell you, this victory is your victory. Thank you for working so hard on behalf of this team. David Barker – whoo! [applause] I also want to thank Fred Hubbell. He called to wish me best. It was a hard-fought campaign. He wished me well. I told him I looked forward to sitting down with him. He represented a lot of Iowans across this state and a lot of issues that are important to them, and I think that this is an opportunity for us to both sit down and work together and make sure that we can maybe find some common ground to address some of the issues that were important to the people that he was out there fighting for. [applause] You know, we both ran for governor wanting the best of our state and so I wish him and his family well.
130	Adjudicated	Pessimistic	As our problems grow larger, it is clear that our current politicians in Washington are not up to the job. In fact, the Washington elite have teamed up with us- have teamed up against us with our own elected representatives. The special interest don't swear on an oath of office to uphold our Constitution. The self-serving lobbyists don't care about protecting our rights and our freedom. They just want to cut the cut of our hard-earned money. They make excuses when we questioned them about voting for trillions in new spending which will saddle our children and grandchildren with dangerously unsustainable debt because it pleases lobbyists; they rubber stamp the interests of wealthy insurance companies by funding Obamacare which is bankrupting our small businesses, killing jobs, and taking doctors away from their patients. Washington politicians have sold out the average citizen, the small business owner, the family farmer, and the entrepreneur who are the backbone of our nation. They don't feel the pain of high taxes, skyrocketing debt, and unaffordable health care because they've exempted themselves. They vote for trade deals that are neither free nor fair to enrich their international corporate paymasters. Meanwhile American industry, especially here in the Empire State or what was the Empire State, industry is losing jobs each and every day. These politicians vote for amnesty which rewards illegal immigrants who have no respect for our laws even though amnesty hurts our law-abiding citizens. They promise to secure our borders and haven't even though our world is becoming more dangerous.
95	Adjudicated	Neutral	If everybody -- if everybody who hearkens to this message -- who everybody, if everybody who feels that the traditional political paradigm is stuck in a 20th-century mechanistic model, you know I’m not running against anyone I'm running with everyone. And apparently 1736 people will be running for the Democratic nomination. I think that will be healthy for democracy. And I think it will be healthy for the Democratic Party. But I have to tell you something, ladies and gentlemen, the 20th-century political mindset got us into this ditch, the 20th-century political mindset is not going to get us out of this ditch. We need an integrated model. We need a model where the consciousness is such that we recognize that if you are not addressing issues of human despair, and if you are not addressing the the the character defects of your whole nation, if you are not addressing ways in which we have to change, then no matter what changes on the outside -- you can have low unemployment. But what does that matter? We talked about that the GDP being the -- waging the measure of our happiness. Really, meanwhile, we have the opioid addiction. So we have the chronic despair, we have the depression, we have the high suicide rates, we need to look beneath the waterline, If we're going to do that -- if we are going to have a campaign. And if we're going to have a campaign that is competitive, so that we could have a presidency that actually is aligned with the higher angels of our nature, where one person has harnessed fear for political purposes, we need to harness love for political purposes.
175	Adjudicated	Neutral	We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anybody hurt. It is a very tough period of time.
